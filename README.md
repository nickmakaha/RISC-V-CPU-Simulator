# RISC-V-CPU-Simulator
A simple implementation to simulate a single-cycle CPU utilizing a 32bit RISC-V interpreter.

The simulation supports the following instructions: 
	  ADD,
		SUB,
		ADDI,
		XOR,
		ANDI,
		SRA,
		LW,
		SW,
		BLT,
		JALR


For testing purposes all final results were assumed to be stored in registers 10 and 11, but all registers can simply be printed out to observe the values in each of them.
